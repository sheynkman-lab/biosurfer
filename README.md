# biosurfer
"Surf" the biological network, from genome to transcriptome to proteome and back to gain insights into human disease biology.

## Installation
Clone the project repository and create a new conda environment if needed. Then, from the top directory of the project, run `pip install --editable .`

The dependency on [`graph-tool`](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/) currently requires a separate installation step. Run `conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool`.

## Quickstart
